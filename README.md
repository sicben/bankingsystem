# Simple Banking System Functionality
This project aims to provide basic banking system functionalities, including deposit, withdrawal, and transfer operations.

# Two Classes Used: Bank and Account
The Bank class (in bank.py) -- Handles the creation of new accounts, retrieval of existing accounts, saves the status to account_book.csv, and retrieves the current status data based on the information in account_book.csv.

The Account class (in account.py) -- Handles deposit, withdrawal, and transfer operations for individual accounts.

Test Script (test.py)
A test script is provided to run the functionalities and ensure they work as expected.
